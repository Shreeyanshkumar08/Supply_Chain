Supplychain is a website to simplify each stage of 
Supply and Supply chain, such that even a local vendor can reach a 
wider audience to get the maximum output out of his service and 
consumer can get the best service according to his needs.

Problem Statement
➢ Many times a consumer wants a service in his locality or his dissatisfied by the poor quality of ongoing 
service, but he don’t know where to reach.
➢At times, monopoly persists in the market due to lack of competition and awareness of a certain niche 
of business to other businessmen.
➢ After the setup of business there is no influence of consumers on the ongoing business in their locality.
➢ Small vendors can't compete in the market because of lack of resources, money and experience.
➢ Business Owners don’t know where to setup their business to get the best output out of his service

Solution
➢We will create a portal where consumers can raise their Supplys in their locality, which could be supported by the consumers having same Supply.
➢The Supplys would be 
visible to vendors/service 
providers who 
can create proposals to 
provide their service
➢Consumers can select the 
best service among all 
proposals by seeing 
ratings, experience ,polls 
etc..
